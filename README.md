### Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler-Bryant, a second-year student at SNHU pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development. Iâ€™m really enjoying my courses so far, especially the basics of programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and learning how to read and create flowcharts and other documentation. I have a wealth of resourcesâ€”websites, videos, and booksâ€”at my disposal to help me create games, websites, and mobile apps. As I continue my studies, I look forward to diving into C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL.


## Also, when I find the time I'll update this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished or anything new that I'm learning about. P.S I'm not very good sharing my life online. So, here's to the first one.
## ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have a Linkedin, linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
## âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to artist from Japan, genres are death metal, rock, jazz, rap.
## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my courses done which are Applied Social Science and Applied Statistics in STEM.
