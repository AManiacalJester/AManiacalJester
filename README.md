### Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler-Bryant, a second-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering. Iâ€™ve been thoroughly enjoying my courses so far.


## Also, when I find the time I'll update this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished or anything new about me.
## ðŸ“« You can reach me on here or at linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
## âš¡ Fun fact: when Iâ€™m not studying or working, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like Man With a Mission, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. Their music keeps me energized and inspired even while I work!
## ðŸ”­ My current courses are Applied Humanities and Introduction to Database Environment.
## ðŸŒ± So far, during my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to use programming languages like Python, Java, and MySQL.
