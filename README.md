### Hi there my name is Tyler-Bryant and I'm a first-year at SNHU, going for a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in software development++. So far I love the courses I have done, learning abput the basics of programming, OOP, and how to read and create flowcharts or other kinds of documents. I do have a arsenal of sites, videos, books all of which have a variety of ways to help me create games, Websites, mobile apps. Later on in my academic journey i will have to learn/use C++, Javascript, Html, CSS, and SQL.


# Also, when I find the time I'll update this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished or anything new that I'm learning about. P.S I'm not very good sharing my life online. So, here's to the first one.
# ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have a Linkedin, linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
# âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to artist from Japan, genres are death metal, rock, jazz, rap.
# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my courses done which are Applied Social Science and Applied Statistics in STEM.
