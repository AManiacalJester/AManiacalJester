### Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler-Bryant, a second-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering. Iâ€™ve been thoroughly enjoying my courses so far, particularly the ones centered around programming and object-oriented design. Iâ€™m also developing skills in reading and creating flowcharts, writing documentation, and diving into algorithms. With a variety of resourcesâ€”websites, tutorials, and booksâ€”at my fingertips, Iâ€™m constantly finding new ways to innovate and build exciting programs, websites, and mobile apps. As I continue my journey, Iâ€™m eager to expand my knowledge in languages like C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and take on even more complex challenges.


## Also, when I find the time I'll update this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished or anything new about me.
## ðŸ“« You can reach me on here or at linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
## âš¡ Fun fact: when Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like Man With a Mission, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. Their music keeps me energized and inspired while I work!
## ðŸ”­ My current courses are Applied Humanities and Introduction to Database Environment.
## ðŸŒ± So far, during my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to use programming languages like Python, Java, and MySQL, each of which has helped me strengthen my programming and problem-solving abilities.
