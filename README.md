### Hi there my name is Tyler-Bryant and I'm almost a first-year in college at SNHU, and I'm going for a degree in Game programming and Development++. So far the programming languages I have used are Python (5 months) and Java (1 month), I do have a arsenal of sites, videos, books all of which of have a variety of ways to help me and to show/create games, Web development, mobile apps, bots, lists, even how to make a professional portfolio. Later I also plan on learning/using C++, C#, and Unreal engine (because they are a part of my curriculum). Some of the things I plan to learn on my own time are intergrating ChstGPT into Unreal engine, learning Rust, project managment. And I'm close to being fully inducted into NSLS (National Society of Leadership and Success), which I'm very execited about.


# Also, when I find the time I'll up date this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished and or new things I'm learning on about. P.S I'm not very good sharing my life online. So, here's to the first one.
# ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have a Linkedin, linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
# âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to artist from Japan, genres are death metal, rock, jazz, rap.
# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my courses done which are Perspectives in Natural science and Found in App Development using Java.
