### Hi there my name is Tyler-Bryant and I'm almost a first-year in college at SNHU, and I'm going for a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in software development++. So far the programming languages I have used are Python (5 months) and Java (1 month), I do have a arsenal of sites, videos, books all of which have a variety of ways to help me create games, Websites, mobile apps, bots. Later I also plan on learning/using C++, Javascript, Html, CSS, and SQL. I'm close to being fully inducted into NSLS (National Society of Leadership and Success), which I'm very execited about.


# Also, when I find the time I'll up date this once or twice a month, adding the projects I have finished and or new things I'm learning on about. P.S I'm not very good sharing my life online. So, here's to the first one.
# ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have a Linkedin, linkedin.com/in/tyler-bryant-b9227a27b
# âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to artist from Japan, genres are death metal, rock, jazz, rap.
# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my courses done which are Perspectives in Natural science and Found in App Development using Java.
